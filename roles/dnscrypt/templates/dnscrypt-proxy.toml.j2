## The proxy will automatically pick working servers from this list.
## Note that the require_* filters do NOT apply when using this setting.
##
## By default, this list is empty and all registered servers matching the
## require_* filters will be used instead.

## Remove the leading # first to enable this; lines starting with # are ignored.

## List of local addresses and ports to listen to. Can be IPv4 and/or IPv6.
## Example with both IPv4 and IPv6:
## listen_addresses = ['127.0.0.1:53', '[::1]:53']
##
## To listen to all IPv4 addresses, use `listen_addresses = ['0.0.0.0:53']`
## To listen to all IPv4+IPv6 addresses, use `listen_addresses = ['[::]:53']`

## Bootstrap resolvers
##
## These are normal, non-encrypted DNS resolvers, that will be only used
## for one-shot queries when retrieving the initial resolvers list and if
## the system DNS configuration doesn't work.
##
## No user queries will ever be leaked through these resolvers, and they will
## not be used after IP addresses of DoH resolvers have been found (if you are
## using DoH).
##
## They will never be used if lists have already been cached, and if the stamps
## of the configured servers already include IP addresses (which is the case for
## most of DoH servers, and for all DNSCrypt servers and relays).
##
## They will not be used if the configured system DNS works, or after the
## proxy already has at least one usable secure resolver.
##
## Resolvers supporting DNSSEC are recommended, and, if you are using
## DoH, bootstrap resolvers should ideally be operated by a different entity
## than the DoH servers you will be using, especially if you have IPv6 enabled.
##
## People in China may want to use 114.114.114.114:53 here.
## Other popular options include 8.8.8.8, 9.9.9.9 and 1.1.1.1.
##
## If more than one resolver is specified, they will be tried in sequence.
##
## TL;DR: put valid standard resolver addresses here. Your actual queries will
## not be sent there. If you're using DNSCrypt or Anonymized DNS and your
## lists are up to date, these resolvers will not even be used.

#########################

## Remote lists of available servers
## Multiple sources can be used simultaneously, but every source
## requires a dedicated cache file.
##
## Refer to the documentation for URLs of public sources.
##
## A prefix can be prepended to server names in order to
## avoid collisions if different sources share the same for
## different servers. In that case, names listed in `server_names`
## must include the prefixes.
##
## If the `urls` property is missing, cache files and valid signatures
## must already be present. This doesn't prevent these cache files from
## expiring after `refresh_delay` hours.
## Cache freshness is checked every 24 hours, so values for 'refresh_delay'
## of less than 24 hours will have no effect.
## A maximum delay of 168 hours (1 week) is imposed to ensure cache freshness.

## Routes are indirect ways to reach DNSCrypt servers.
##
## A route maps a server name ("server_name") to one or more relays that will be
## used to connect to that server.
##
## A relay can be specified as a DNS Stamp (either a relay stamp, or a
## DNSCrypt stamp) or a server name.
##
## The following example routes "example-server-1" via `anon-example-1` or `anon-example-2`,
## and "example-server-2" via the relay whose relay DNS stamp is
## "sdns://gRIxMzcuNzQuMjIzLjIzNDo0NDM".
##
## !!! THESE ARE JUST EXAMPLES !!!
##
## Review the list of available relays from the "relays.md" file, and, for each
## server you want to use, define the relays you want connections to go through.
##
## Carefully choose relays and servers so that they are run by different entities.
##
## "server_name" can also be set to "*" to define a default route, for all servers:
## { server_name='*', via=['anon-example-1', 'anon-example-2'] }
##
## If a route is ["*"], the proxy automatically picks a relay on a distinct network.
## { server_name='*', via=['*'] } is also an option, but is likely to be suboptimal.
##
## Manual selection is always recommended over automatic selection, so that you can
## select (relay,server) pairs that work well and fit your own criteria (close by or
## in different countries, operated by different entities, on distinct ISPs...)

# routes = [
#    { server_name='example-server-1', via=['anon-example-1', 'anon-example-2'] },
